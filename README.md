TinyHexapod
===========

A tiny hexapod which i built being inspired by the pololu simple hexapod walker "pololu.com/docs/0j42/all".  
The servos are controlled using Atmega8 running a Software servo library instead of hardware. 
Because software servo library allows us to add more than 3 servos.

For now i have only written the movement for front and back but we can easily add left and right movement also.

Here is a link to the video demo of my prototype http://youtu.be/eEiKT8PZ-l8
